== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I use this plugin? =

To easily keep track of your social media presence across many different services.

= How often is my data updated? =

Once per hour. Please note that in the case of Feedburner, only data from yesterday and the day before yesterday is available, so you won't see live changes.

= Why aren't I getting any data on Feedburner? =

Ensure that your Feedburner URI is set correctly. Your URI is just the portion of your RSS url following the feeds.feedburner.com:

For example, 'mightybrand' is the URI in the feed below:

http://feeds.feedburner.com/mightybrand

IMPORTANT: You also have to enable the Feedburner Awareness API. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Login to your Feedburner account
1. Select the feed you want to monitor
1. Go to the 'Publicize' tab
1. Click on the Awareness API link
1. Click 'Activate'

Data should start flowing shortly.
